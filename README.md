# BannerlordArenaXP

This modification enhances the experience points (XP) gain in the Arena for Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord. Normally, players gain 0.0625f% XP during practice fights and 0.33f% XP during tournaments. This modification increases these values to 0.50f% for both types of Arena combat, allowing players to earn more XP.
